# Express API on AWS Lambda (via AWS SAM)

This service runs an Express application on AWS Lambda behind an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API. Deployment uses AWS SAM (not Serverless Framework).

We use the `serverless-http` adapter to translate API Gateway events to Express requests. This adapter library is unrelated to the Serverless Framework.

## Usage

### Deployment (AWS SAM)

```
npm ci
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-node-express-dynamodb-api" to stage "dev" (ap-northeast-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-dev (109s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-dev-api (3.8 MB)
```

Note: In the current template, the API is public. For production, consider adding an authorizer to API Gateway and secrets management for JWT.

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can create a new user by calling the corresponding endpoint:

```
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"name": "John", "userId": "someUserId"}'
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{ "userId": "someUserId", "name": "John" }
```

You can later retrieve the user by `userId` by calling the following endpoint:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/users/someUserId
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{ "userId": "someUserId", "name": "John" }
```

### Local development

For local API + DynamoDB Local, use Docker Compose at the repository root:

```
docker compose up --build
```

It runs `node local.js` inside the container and exposes `http://localhost:4000`.
